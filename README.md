# SI507-FinalProject

I am interested in scraping information from coinmarketcap.com to pull in data of the Top 10 cryptocurrencies.
This data will contain the:
• Market Cap
• Price
• Circulating Supply
• Price change over last 24H

I will also pull off historical data about just Bitcoin. This will look at the High price for each day over the last past month. It will pull the date and high price for Bitcoin for this time period.
